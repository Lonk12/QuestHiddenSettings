# Quest Hidden Settings
Quickly manage hidden settings on the Quest / Quest 2

This app exposes a number of useful settings pages on the Quest that are not otherwise accessible

## Current Functionality
 - Guided setup for Private DNS, with a list of popular servers, including ad-blockers (Adblock in all apps!)
 - Link to Date and Time settings, allowing clock to be changed
 - Link to App Settings, allowing apps to be killed and app data/cache to be wiped
 - Link to Android's accessibility settings. High contrast text and mono audio work
 - Link to Device Info, showing build numbers and allowing you to change the device name for bluetooth

All of these features exist, but are inaccessible within the normal Quest UI
